        (TestResultsView._populateTestPane): Add tablesorter to the class name and wrap tr's inside a tbody so that tablesorter
        could sort them.

        Copied admin.css, admin-header.php, admin-footer.php, builders.php, repositories.php from WebKit Perf Monitor.
        (Unfortunately WebKit Perf Monitor hasn't been committed into WebKit repository just yet.)

        Updated various parts of index.html to linkify test names, build numbers, and bubbles (to results page).

        * admin/admin.css: Added.
        * admin/builders.php: Added.
        * admin/index.php: Removed the duplicated code now that it uses admin-header.php.
        * admin/repositories.php: Added.
        * api/manifest.php: Use camelCase for blame_url and build_url to be consistent with other JSON properties.
        Also exported testCategories from config so that we can linkify test names in the dashboard.
        * include/admin-footer.php: Added.
        * include/admin-header.php: Added.
        * include/config.json: Added test categories. This avoids hard-coding the URL to trac in php/js.
        * include/init-database.sql: Added name and build_url to builders table and category to tests.
        * include/test-results.php: Assume the test category to be LayoutTest for now.

        * index.html:
        (TestResultsView): Initialize _builders, _slaves, _repositories, _testCategories as dictionaries as intended.
        (TestResultsView.setTestCategories): Added.
        (TestResultsView._createResultCell): Dynamically resolve URLs of results page and and build page.
        (TestResultsView._populateTestPane): Linkify the test name. Unfortunately we don't have a test object anywhere.
        We need to figure out a way to find the test object here eventually. For now, hard-coding "LayoutTest" works.
        (TestResultsView._linkifiedTestName): Added.
        (TestResultsView._createBuildsAndComputeSlownessOfResults): Takes builderId to set "builder" property on each
        result object as it's used by Build class.
        (TestResultsView._populateBuilderPane):
        (fetchManigest):

        * js/build.js:
        (Build.buildUrl): Support $builderName so that we don't have to keep repeating builder names in the database.
        (Build.revision): Don't access [0] if revisions[repositoryId] was undefined.

        * include/config.json: Specify the default cache time to be 10 minutes.

        * index.html:
        (TestResultsView._createResultCell): Don't put '-' in a result cell without time.
        (TestResultsView._populateTestPane): Create an array of build times ordered from the newest to the oldest.
        Not that build.time() is the newest commit time among all repository for each result. e.g. if we had
        both WebKit and Safari repository information in a given result, the newer of the two will be used.
        (TestResultsView._createTestResultHeader): Added.
        (TestResultsView._createBuildsAndComputeSlownessOfResults): Extracted from _createTestResultRow so
        that _populateTestPane could use Build object before calling _createTestResultRow.
        (TestResultsView._createTestResultRow): Takes buildTimes. Insert an empty cell for a build time if
        the current row doesn't contain that a result for that build time.
        (TestResultsView._populateBuilderPane):
        * main.css: Tweaked the style so that bubbles are aligned vertically without '-'.
