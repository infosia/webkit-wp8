test262j is the original Java-centric version for test262 on Android. 
The application was written in all Java except for the part that runs
the actual script via JavaScriptCore which must be done in C via JNI.

Performance problems were noticed in the Java version, with strong 
suspicion that the Dalvik garbage collector and memory management 
issues in general were the culprit. Thus test262c was implemented 
for comparison.

test262c is a re-write of most of application in C. Much of the code
is shared with or extremely similar to the Mac/iOS versions. The core
run test loop is now writen in C, along with the script/string manipulations,
since it was believed these were the bottlenecks in the Java version.
The GUI is done via function pointer callbacks back into Java since 
GUI APIs are Java-only. The socket server is shared C code with Mac/iOS,
though the Zeroconf code is Java based since Android's NSD APIs are 
Java-only.

The results have confirmed the C version to be significantly faster than 
the Java version.
