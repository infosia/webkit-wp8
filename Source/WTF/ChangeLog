        StringImpl::lower() should return a PassRef.
        <https://webkit.org/b/123190>

        Test the waters and hack enough of StringImpl to be able to return
        a PassRef<StringImpl> from lower().

        Also gave String a constructor that takes a PassRef<StringImpl>.

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        TYPE_CASTS_BASE is being used by node|element type casts. However, it is difficult
        to be used by other type casts. For instance, CSSValue, Accessibility and so on.
        This patch modifies TYPE_CASTS_BASE which can support other type casts.

        Besides TYPE_CASTS_BASE body is moved from node.h to Assertions.h.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        * wtf/PassRef.h:
        (WTF::PassRef::get):

            Added a get() helper to facilitate writing functions that
            construct a new object and call some functions on it before
            returning it.

        (WTF::PassRef::dropRef):

            This will deref() the referenced object and mark the PassRef
            as "passed." This is used in code paths where the PassRef is
            going to go out of scope with nobody to take it over.

        (WTF::PassRef::leakRef):

            Renamed takeReference() to leakRef() and made it public so
            we don't have to awkwardly sink the PassRef into a Ref for
            e.g static locals.

        * wtf/RefPtr.h:
        (WTF::RefPtr::releaseNonNull):

            Added RefPtr::releaseNonNull() for a convenient way of creating
            a PassRef<T> from a RefPtr<T>. This function may only be called
            if the RefPtr is known to be non-null.
